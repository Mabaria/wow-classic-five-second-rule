# wow-classic-five-second-rule

This is an addon for **World of Warcraft Classic** (set to release on August 27. 2019).

The purpose of this addon is to track the so-called "5-second-rule" (5SR), which refers to the time needed to elapse after spending mana, for mana regen to resume. Notable, this rule excludes "mp5"-gear. 

### Commands

**/fsr unlock**   Unlock the frame and enable drag.

**/fsr lock**     Lock the frame and disable drag.

**/fsr reset**    Resets the position and size of the frame.

### Planned Work

- Add options frame.
- Add sizing configuration.
- Add optional warnings when on low mana (motivate usage of 5SR).
